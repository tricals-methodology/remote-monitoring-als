**This study is still in peer review. Information on this page may be not be correct/finished.**

This research repository contains all material related to our study *"Remote monitoring of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using wearable sensors detects differences in disease progression and survival: a prospective cohort study"*.

# What is the project about?
There is an urgent need for objective, more sensitive, and less burdensome measures to quantify clinical disease progression and gauge the response to treatment in clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this prospective cohort study, we determine the ability of a novel outcome derived from a hip-worn accelerometer to detect differential clinical disease progression and assess its longitudinal associations with overall survival in 97 patients with ALS during a multi-year observation period.
